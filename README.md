# EchoGen

### what is this? (v0.1)

EchoGen lets you learn about anything in a way that feels natural to you. Just type in a topic, pick how you want it explained—like a podcast, YouTuber, or step-by-step tutorial—and EchoGen will turn it into an audio you can listen to or download.

## ✅ v0.1 DONE  

In **v0.1**, we built the core frontend: a simple input form to enter topics, choose explanation style, and generate audio with Google OAuth and basic audio history.  

On the backend, we integrated Gemini/OpenRouter for text, ElevenLabs for audio, Postgres for storage, and Vercel Blob for files, with authentication and history retrieval in place.
